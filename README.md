# React Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning React through hands-on practice, UI mini projects, and step-by-step implementation of core to advanced React concepts.  
It includes both **classwork-based practice folders** and **independent projects built to apply real-world concepts**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- JavaScript Functions
- CSS Fundamentals
- React Components
- Props
- useState (Basic & Advanced)
- Form Handling
- Two-Way Data Binding
- Local Storage
- API Calling
- useEffect Hook
- Gallery Project
- UI Mini Projects
- Tailwind CSS

---

## 🖼️ Gallery Project (Latest – Main Project)

The **Gallery Project** is a standalone React project built to practice real-world frontend concepts.

### Key Features
- Image gallery using API data (Picsum API)
- Pagination with Material UI
- Skeleton loading cards for better UX
- Lazy loading and smooth image transitions
- Reusable component-based architecture
- Styled using Tailwind CSS
- Fixed bottom pagination layout

### Concepts Applied
- `useState` & `useEffect`
- API fetching with Axios
- Conditional rendering
- Component reusability
- Props-based data flow
- Performance-focused UI improvements
- Clean folder structure

> ⚠️ Note:  
> The earlier **17-gallery-project** folder was created as part of classwork practice.  
> The **current Gallery Project** is an improved and independent implementation with better UI, UX, and structure.

## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Daily hands-on React practice
- Topic-wise structured and numbered folders
- Gradual progression from basics to advanced React concepts
- UI-focused learning for better visual understanding
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Refactoring projects into reusable components
